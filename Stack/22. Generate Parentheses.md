## Backtracking Approach
We utilize a backtracking approach that uses a stack to generate all the valid possible combinations of parentheses. At each step of the recursion tree, we can go one of two ways, add an open parenthesis `(`, or add a close parenthesis `)`. This would lead to potentially invalid combinations of parenthesis and would lead to a massive tree, so we can prune it with the following constraints: 
1) We only add an open parenthesis if the number of open parenthesis is less than n
2) We only add a close parenthesis if the number of closed parentheses is less than the number of open parentheses
3)  (Base Case:) We end the current decision tree path when the number of close and open parentheses are the same.
The stack helps us "build" our string of parentheses.
``` python
class Solution:
    def generateParenthesis(self, n: int) -> List[str]:
        stack = []
        result = []

        def backtrack(numOpen, numClosed):
            if numOpen == numClosed == n:
                result.append(''.join(stack))
                return
            
            if numOpen < n:
                stack.append('(')
                backtrack(numOpen + 1, numClosed)
                stack.pop()
            
            if numClosed < numOpen:
                stack.append(')')
                backtrack(numOpen, numClosed + 1)
                stack.pop()
        
        backtrack(0, 0)
        
        return result
```
The time complexity is O((4^n)/sqrt(n)) (this is quite a rambunctious runtime!), to derive this, please see ChatGPT as I cannot be bothered to write the process down, and frankly, very few leetcode problems are going to have such unruly runtimes. The space complexity is O(n) in the worst case since our stack grows to size at most 2n and O(2n) = O(n).
