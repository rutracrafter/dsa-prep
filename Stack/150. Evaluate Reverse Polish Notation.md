## Stack Approach
We can use a stack to keep track of the elements we have, and when we run into an operator, perform that operation on the two elements atop the stack. Watch out for operations that are not commutative, namely subtraction and division.
``` python
class Solution:
    def evalRPN(self, tokens: List[str]) -> int:
        stack = []
        for token in tokens:
            if token == '+':
                stack.append(stack.pop() + stack.pop())
            elif token == '-':
                a, b = stack.pop(), stack.pop()
                stack.append(b - a)
            elif token == '*':
                stack.append(stack.pop() * stack.pop())
            elif token == '/':
                a, b = stack.pop(), stack.pop()
                stack.append(int(b / a))
            else:
                stack.append(int(token))
        return stack[0]
```
The time complexity is O(n) since we at most add and then remove each element once from the stack. The space complexity is O(n) since we are using a stack to keep track of the elements, and it grows to length at most n.
## Recursive Approach
This solution is not very efficient compared to the stack approach since we are using recursion which can cause the call stack to explode, however, I find that it is conceptually quite satisfying. We are basically evaluating it back to front, and any time we run into an operator, we recursively evaluate the right and left operands (first pop is right, second pop is left).
``` python
class Solution:
    def evalRPN(self, tokens: List[str]) -> int:
        def dfs():
            token = tokens.pop()
            if token not in ['+', '-', '*', '/']:
                return int(token)
            
            right = dfs()
            left = dfs()
            
            if token == '+':
                return left + right
            elif token == '-':
                return left - right
            elif token == '*':
                return left * right
            elif token == '/':
                return int(left / right)
        
        return dfs()
```
The time complexity is O(n) since we only "see" each element once. The space complexity is O(n) in the worst case since our call stack only grows to size at most n.
