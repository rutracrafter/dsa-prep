## Stack Approach
The best explanation in my opinion is linked here: 
``` python
class Solution:
    def carFleet(self, target: int, position: List[int], speed: List[int]) -> int:
        pos_speed_pairs = [(position[i], speed[i]) for i in range(len(position))]
        sorted_pairs = sorted(pos_speed_pairs, key=lambda x: x[0])

        stack = []
        stack.append(sorted_pairs[-1])

        for i in range(len(sorted_pairs) - 2, -1, -1):
            earlier = sorted_pairs[i]
            later = stack[-1]
            earlier_arrival = (target - earlier[0]) / earlier[1] 
            later_arrival = (target - later[0]) / later[1]

            if earlier_arrival > later_arrival:
                stack.append(earlier)
        
        return len(stack)
```
Time complexity O(n * log(n)) in the worst case since we sort. Space complexity is O(n) since in the worst case we need to store all cars in the stack.
