## Stack Approach
This stack approach is not at all intuitive, which is why I personally prefer the Dynamic Programming approach as it makes more intuitive sense in my head, but in principle both solutions work similarly. We use a stack to keep track of the temperatures we have seen and their indices, if we run into a temperature that is higher than the latest one (top of the stack) we have seen, we set the number of days for a warmer temperatures at the latest stack temperature index to the distance between the two days. On each iteration of the for loop, at the end, we always push the current element onto the stack as our inner while loop will always remove all of the elements of the stack less than or equal to the current element, with maintains the property that our stack keeps what we have seen in decreasing order (from bottom to top of the stack).
``` python

```
The time complexity is O(n) since we we at most push and then pop and element from the stack once. The space complexity is O(n) since out stack grows to size at most n.

## Dynamic Programming Approach
We iterate from back to front of the result array (initialized to all zeroes) and while the element at position j is less than the element at position i, we move j to be the next warmest day (`j += res[j]`), this allows us to skip unnecessary computations as we only consider the days that are possible warmer than the current day.
