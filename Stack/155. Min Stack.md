## Two Stack Approach
We use two stacks to keep track of both the regular stack elements and the minimum element seen thus far. This allows us to keep track of smallest element seen so far, and prevents issues with cases where the min value is removed, but there is no way to update the variable since we don't know what the next smallest element is if it is lower on the stack. We could just search the stack every time we are to return the smallest element, but then we decrease efficiency since we need to check all elements of the stack on every such operation.
``` python
class MinStack:

    def __init__(self):
        self.stack = []
        self.minstack = []

    def push(self, val: int) -> None:
        minval = min(val, self.minstack[-1] if self.minstack else val)
        self.minstack.append(minval)
        self.stack.append(val)

    def pop(self) -> None:
        top = self.stack.pop()
        self.minstack.pop()
        return top

    def top(self) -> int:
        return self.stack[-1]

    def getMin(self) -> int:
        return self.minstack[-1]


# Your MinStack object will be instantiated and called as such:
# obj = MinStack()
# obj.push(val)
# obj.pop()
# param_3 = obj.top()
# param_4 = obj.getMin()
```
The time complexity is O(1) for all operations. The space complexity is O(n) since we use two stacks to keep track of the stack elements and the min at that point.
## Stack and Single Variable Approach
We can use some clever arithmetic to keep track of the smallest element using a single variable by storing the difference of the pushed value, along with the min value we have seen, in this case we have a way to update the smallest element when popping a value by checking if the value popped is negative, we do something similar for top in the case where the value is positive, and for getMin, we just return the minimum stores element. This is a clever approach, however, it is not as clear to work with when compared to the two stack approach, and if has the downside that the elements are not stored in their actual forms, but rather as differences, which is not really a bad thing unless you for some reason need to look at elements below the top element (this shouldn't happen in an actual stack though, however, python stacks are just lists that you append to and pop from).
``` python
class MinStack:

    def __init__(self):
        self.min = float('inf')
        self.stack = []

    def push(self, val: int) -> None:
        if not self.stack:
            self.stack.append(0)
            self.min = val
        else:
            self.stack.append(val - self.min)
            if val < self.min:
                self.min = val

    def pop(self) -> None:
        if not self.stack:
            return

        pop = self.stack.pop()

        if pop < 0:
            self.min = self.min - pop

    def top(self) -> int:
        top = self.stack[-1]
        if top > 0:
            return top + self.min
        else:
            return self.min

    def getMin(self) -> int:
        return self.min


# Your MinStack object will be instantiated and called as such:
# obj = MinStack()
# obj.push(val)
# obj.pop()
# param_3 = obj.top()
# param_4 = obj.getMin()
```
The time complexity is O(1) for all operations. The space complexity is O(n) since our stack grows to at most size n.
