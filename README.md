# dsa-prep

This is a repository containing my technical interview DSA preparation via the Neetcode 150 curated list of Leetcode questions.

If the commit messages look a little funky, it's because I'm using Obsidian for my note-taking and the obsidian-git community plugin auto commits and pushes every five minutes with the current date and time.
