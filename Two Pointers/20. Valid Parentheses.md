## Stack Approach
The most straightforward and efficient way to approach this problem is by using a stack to keep track of what opening symbols we have seen and to determine if the closing symbols that we see match up with the opening symbols that we have seen. We are also going to use a dictionary to create a mapping between each closing symbol and each opening symbol to allow us to check the correspondence between the current symbol and the symbol atop the stack. Keep in mind that if we run into a closing symbol and our stack is empty, we return false since there is no way to make such a string valid. Also, at the end make sure to return true if the stack is empty, otherwise return false.
``` python
def isValid(self, s: str) -> bool:
	dic = {
		')':'(',
		'}':'{',
		']':'[',
	}
	stack = list()
	for c in s:
		if c in dic:
			if len(stack) != 0 and dic.get(c) == stack[-1]:
				stack.pop()
			else:
				return False
		else:
			stack.append(c)
	if len(stack) == 0:
		return True
	return False
```
This solution runs in O(n) time since we must iterate through each element in the string once, and the space complexity is O(n) since in the worst case we end up adding all of the characters in the string to the stack.

Key Takeaways:
- Before getting to the coding, really sit down and think though the problem at hand. Manually run through how your solution behaves for a few different inputs. Can you see any potential edge cases? How does your solution deal with the edge cases? Doing all of this will make the coding
