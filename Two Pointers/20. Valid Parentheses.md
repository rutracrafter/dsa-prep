## Stack Approach
The most straightforward and efficient way to approach this problem is by using a stack to keep track of what opening symbols we have seen and to determine if the closing symbols that we see match up with the opening symbols that we have seen. We are also going to use a dictionary to create a mapping between each closing symbol and each opening symbol. Keep in mind that if we run into a closing symbol and our stack is empty, we return false since there is no way to make such a string valid. Also make sure to check at the end if the stack is empty or not 
``` python
def isValid(self, s: str) -> bool:
	dic = {
		')':'(',
		'}':'{',
		']':'[',
	}
	stack = list()
	for c in s:
		if c in dic:
			if len(stack) != 0 and dic.get(c) == stack[-1]:
				stack.pop()
			else:
				return False
		else:
			stack.append(c)
	if len(stack) == 0:
		return True
	return False
```
