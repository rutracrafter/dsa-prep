Since we are given that the input array is sorted in non-decreasing order, we can use one pointer on the left, and one pointer on the right. If the elements at those positions do not sum up to the target we decide whether we move the left or right pointer based on whether the sum was greater than or smaller than the target value. Remember to return the indices of the two elements, plus one.
``` python
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, numbers: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        i = 0
        j = len(numbers) - 1
		
        while (i < j):
            if (numbers[i] + numbers[j] == target):
                return [i + 1, j + 1]
            elif (numbers[i] + numbers[j] > target):
                j -= 1
            else:
                i += 1
```
The time complexity is O(n) in the worst case since we pass through every element of the array. The space complexity is O(1) since we are just using two pointers.
