## Recursive Approach
For this approach we recursively check whether the left and right subtrees 
``` python
class Solution:
    def isSameTree(self, p: Optional[TreeNode], q: Optional[TreeNode]) -> bool:
        if p == None and q == None:
            return True
  
        if (p == None or q == None) or (p.val != q.val):
            return False
        return self.isSameTree(p.left, q.left) and self.isSameTree(p.right, q.right)
```
blah blah blah
## Iterative Approach
blah blah blah
``` python
# Code goes here
```
blah blah blah

Key Takeaways:
- When doing recursive problems, take some time to really think about the base case(s) as there can sometimes be more than one which makes some problems quite tricky!
