## Recursive Approach
For an arbitrary node, we can just recursively get the maximum depth between the left and right subtrees and add 1 to it, making sure that our base case is when the node is null.
``` python
def maxDepth(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
	if root == None:
		return 0
	leftDepth = self.maxDepth(root.left)
	rightDepth = self.maxDepth(root.right)

	return 1 + max(leftDepth, rightDepth)
```
This solution run in O(n) time since we are
