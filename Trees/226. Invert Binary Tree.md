## Recursive Approach
To invert a binary tree (mirror it down the middle), we essentially need to invert its left and right sub tree, and for each of those sub trees, we have to invert the left and right sub trees, and so on. This indicates that we should take a recursive approach!
``` python
def invertTree(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> Optional[TreeNode]:
        if root == None:
            return None
  
        tmp = root.left
        root.left = self.invertTree(root.right)
        root.right = self.invertTree(tmp)
  
        return root
```
This solution runs in O(n) time since we make one call to invertTree for each node of the original tree. Since our stack will only ever get as long as the height of the tree, the space complexity for this problem is O(n) in the worst case since for a very skewed tree, the height of the tree is n, however, in the case of a balanced or semi-balanced tree, our runtime will be O(log(n)) as the height of such a tree would be log(n).
## Iterative Approach
Any problem that can be solved recursively can also be solved iteratively. In this case, we can use either DFS (stack) or BFS (queue) to invert the binary tree layer by layer.
### DFS
``` python
def invertTree(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> Optional[TreeNode]:
        if root == None:
            return None
        stack = []
        stack.append(root)
  
        while len(stack) != 0:
            curr = stack.pop()
  
            tmp = curr.left
            curr.left = curr.right
            curr.right = tmp
  
            if curr.left != None:
                stack.append(curr.left)
            if curr.right != None:
                stack.append(curr.right)
        return root
```
### BFS
``` python
def invertTree(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> Optional[TreeNode]:
        if root == None:
            return None
        queue = []
        queue.append(root)
  
        while len(queue) != 0:
            curr = queue.pop(0)
  
            tmp = curr.left
            curr.left = curr.right
            curr.right = tmp
  
            if curr.left != None:
                queue.append(curr.left)
            if curr.right != None:
                queue.append(curr.right)
        return root
```
Both of these solutions run in O(n) time since we visit each node exactly once. As for space complexity, DFS has a space complexity of O(n) in the case where the height of the tree is highly skewed, and O(log(n)) in the case of a balanced tree, just as in the recursive solution. However, for BFS, we have O(n) in the worst case scenario for a highly skewed tree, but this time we have O(n) in the case of a balanced tree as the maximum width of a balanced tree is n/2 and O(n/2) = O(n).

Key Takeaways:
- Any problem that can be done iteratively can also be done recursively, and any problem that can be done recursively, can also be done iteratively! It is not unheard of for an interviewer to ask you to implement an iterative solution after you implement the recursive one, and vice versa, so it can really pay off to learn both ways!
