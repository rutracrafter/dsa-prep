## Recursive Approach
To invert a binary tree (mirror it down the middle), we essentially need to invert its left and right sub tree, and for each of those sub trees, we have to invert the left and right sub trees, and so on. This indicates that we should take a recursive approach!
``` python
def invertTree(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> Optional[TreeNode]:
        if root == None:
            return None
  
        tmp = root.left
        root.left = self.invertTree(root.right)
        root.right = self.invertTree(tmp)
  
        return root
```
This solution runs in O()
