## Recursive Approach
We first need a way to check if given the roots of two tree, those two trees are the same, we have already done [[100. Same Tree]] so we know how this should be done. Now, we need to go through each node of the tree and check whether the given subtree is the same as the subtree stemming from the current node.
``` python
class Solution:
    def sameTree(self, p: Optional[TreeNode], q: Optional[TreeNode]) -> bool:
        if p == None and q == None:
            return True
        elif (p == None or q == None) or (p.val != q.val):
            return False

        return self.sameTree(p.left, q.left) and self.sameTree(p.right, q.right)
  
    def isSubtree(self, root: Optional[TreeNode], subRoot: Optional[TreeNode]) -> bool:
        if self.sameTree(root, subRoot):
            return True
        elif root == None and subRoot == None:
            return True
        elif root == None:
            return False

        return self.isSubtree(root.left, subRoot) or self.isSubtree(root.right, subRoot)
```
This solution runs in O(n^2) time since for each node of the tree, we must check that subtree against the given subtree which takes in the worst case O(n) time, n * O(n) = O(n^2). The space complexity for this solution is going to be O(n) in the worst case when both the given tree and subtree are heavily skewed, but O(log(n)) in the case of both trees being balanced or approximately balanced. This is because the call stack will only ever get as big as the h
