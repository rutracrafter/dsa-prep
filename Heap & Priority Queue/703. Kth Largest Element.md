## List and Sorting Approach
We can use a sorted list of size k to keep track of the kth largest element (the element at position 0), when we add a new value to this list, we must check that the new length does not exceed k, and if it does, we remove the smallest element. (*This approach is essentially simulating a heap.*)
``` python
class KthLargest:
    def __init__(self, k: int, nums: List[int]):
        self.k = k
        self.minheap = nums
        self.minheap.sort()
        while len(self.minheap) > self.k:
            self.minheap.pop(0)
  
    def add(self, val: int) -> int:
        self.minheap.append(val)
        self.minheap.sort()
        if len(self.minheap) > self.k:
            self.minheap.pop(0)
        return self.minheap[0]
```
The time complexity for the constructor method is O(n * log(n)) in the worst case, since we must sort the list. The space complexity depends on the sorting algorithm that is used, however, python's `.sort()` method uses Timsort, in the worst case, the space complexity is O(n). For the add method, the time complexity is also O(n * log(n)) in the worst case since we sort the list, the space complexity is yet again O(n) for the same reason as the constructor method.
## Min Heap Approach
We can use the same approach as we did for the list and Sorting Approach above, except this time, we use a more appropriate data structure, the mighty heap!
``` python
class KthLargest:
    def __init__(self, k: int, nums: List[int]):
        self.k = k
        self.minheap = nums
        heapq.heapify(self.minheap)
        while len(self.minheap) > self.k:
            heapq.heappop(self.minheap)
  
    def add(self, val: int) -> int:
        heapq.heappush(self.minheap, val)
        if len(self.minheap) > self.k:
            heapq.heappop(self.minheap)
        return self.minheap[0]
```
The time complexity for the constructor is going to be O(n * log(n)) in the worst case as we might have to end up removing around n elements from our heap which takes O(log(n)) operations per element removal. The space complexity is going ot
