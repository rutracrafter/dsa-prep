## Iteration Approach
We start from right to left, our carry starts out as 1 since we are adding 1 to the number. For each digit, add 1 to it, if the sum of that digit and 1 is greater than 10, keep the sum mod 10 as that digit and set the carry to 1, otherwise, just add 1 to that number.
``` python
class Solution:
    def plusOne(self, digits: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        i = len(digits) - 1
        carry = 1
        while i >= 0:
            sum = digits[i] + carry
            digits[i] = sum % 10
            carry = sum // 10
            i -= 1
        if carry == 1:
            digits.insert(0, 1)
        return digits
```
The time complexity if O(1) since we are given that the number of digits is at most 100. The space complexity if O(1) since we are doing the manipulations in place.
## Iteration Approach (Early Stoppage)
We basically do the same as the regular iterative approach, except now we check the condition that is the number is < 9, add one and return, otherwise if we iterate through all the number from right to left and there are no numbers less than 9, we just return the original list with a 1 appended to the front.
``` python
class Solution:
    def plusOne(self, digits: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        i = len(digits) - 1
        while i >= 0:
            if digits[i] < 9:
                digits[i] += 1
                return digits
            digits[i] = 0
            i -= 1
        return [1] + digits
```
The time and space complexity is the same as above, except this time it can stop early, therefore in practice it is going to generally run faster than the other one.
