## Bitwise Approach
In this approach we are essentially going to be using the same login as [[191. Number of 1 Bits]] to count the number of 1 bits for each of the values that i takes on.
``` python
class Solution:
    def countBits(self, n: int) -> List[int]:
        result = [0] * (n + 1)
        for i in range(n + 1):
            num = i
            while num:
                num &= (num - 1)
                result[i] += 1
        return result
```
This solution runs in O(n) time since for each value of i (there are n + 1 values of i), we perform a constant time operation (the maximum value of i is 10^5 which is less than 2^17). The space complexity for this solution is O(n) since we end up using an auxiliary array of size n + 1.
## Dynamic Programming Approach 1
We can use the values that we have already calculated to help us in future computations, this problem is tricky, however, because the recurrence relation is not immediately simple. We keep track of an offset variable that will be updated whenever i reaches a new power of 2, or in other words, when the most significant bit increases by one place value to the left.
``` python
class Solution:
    def countBits(self, n: int) -> List[int]:
        dp = [0] * (n + 1)
        offset = 1
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            if offset * 2 == i:
                offset = i
            dp[i] = 1 + dp[i - offset]
        return dp
```
## Dynamic Programming Approach 2
We can use a very similar approach as above, but this time let's use bitwise operations as they are often faster than regular arithmetic. The idea here is that for each i, we are going to use i/2 (left shift once) + the least significant bit of i to get the value for the dp array at position i. This recurrence relation is not at all immediately clear, however, if you look at it from the perspective of multiplying by 2 (right shift once) and either adding one or zero, we create a clear mapping from i to (i * 2) + 0 and (i * 2) + 1 which works because left shifting by one is like multiplying by two, however, in binary, i << 1 (which is essentially i * 2) will be the same representation as i, but with a zero appended to the end. This mapping necessary for the recurrence relation is most clearly seen by drawing it out and tracing an example by hand to see what it is doing. Note that it is doing something similar to the idea of the offset in the previous DP solution, however, it is a bit different in nature.
```python
class Solution:
    def countBits(self, n: int) -> List[int]:
        dp = [0] * (n + 1)
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            dp[i] = dp[i >> 1] + (i & 1)
        return dp
```
This solution runs in O(n) time, and O(n) space.
