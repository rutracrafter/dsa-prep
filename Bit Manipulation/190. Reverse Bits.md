We can create a new variable to store the result, and just add to it the right most (or least significant) bit of the binary representation of n, then we right shift n so the next bit to look at is at the
``` python
class Solution:
    def reverseBits(self, n: int) -> int:
        result = 0
  
        for i in range(32):
            bit = n & 1
            result = (result | bit)
            if i < 31:
                n >>= 1
                result <<= 1

        return result
```
This runs in O(1) time since we are given that the number is always 32 bits. The space complexity is also O(1) since we are using a single variable to store and return the result.
