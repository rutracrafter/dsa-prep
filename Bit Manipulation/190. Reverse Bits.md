## Bitwise Approach
We can create a new variable to store the result, and just add to it the right most (or least significant) bit of the binary representation of n, then we right shift n so the next bit to look at is the new right most bit, and we left shift the result to create the space for appending the next bit. We also have an edge case that we need to be careful of and that is on the last iteration, we actually don't want to do any shifting since we have already set the last bit, so we have a condition to check for this. 
``` python
class Solution:
    def reverseBits(self, n: int) -> int:
        result = 0
  
        for i in range(32):
            bit = n & 1
            result = (result | bit)
            if i < 31:
                n >>= 1
                result <<= 1

        return result
```
This runs in O(1) time since we are given that the number is always 32 bits. The space complexity is also O(1) since we are using a single variable to store and return the result.
