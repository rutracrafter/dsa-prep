## Set Approach
Create a set with the given numbers, check if each number from 0 to length of nums + 1 (inclusive) is in the set, if it isn't return that number.
``` python
class Solution:
    def missingNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        search_set = set(nums)
        for i in range(len(nums) + 1):
            if i not in search_set:
                return i
```
Time complexity is O(n) since creating the set is O(n) and check all the elements the set is O(n). Space complexity is O(n) since he
