## Bitwise Approach
We can look at each bit from right to left (least significant bit to most significant bit) and just sum up the number of 1s we see. The easier way to do this is with the bitwise operation '&' to compare the current number with 1 which will return 1 if the number's LSB (least significant bit) is 1, and 0 otherwise.
``` python
class Solution:
    def hammingWeight(self, n: int) -> int:
        setBits = 0
        while n > 0:
            setBits += n & 1
            n = n >> 1
        return setBits
```
This solution runs in O(1) time since we are essentially performing a linear scan of each bit value of the original number, however, we are given in the problem that the number has at most 32 bits. The space complexity is O(1) since we are only using one integer variable to keep track of the total number of 1s in the binary representation of a number.
## Bitwise Approach (Optimized)
This optimization is very minimal, but may indeed be worth considering. Instead of checking if each value of the number is 1, we can just sum our result by 1 for each 1 we see. This can be achieved by using '&' on our number with itself minus 1, n & (n - 1), this will get rid of the right most 1.
``` python
class Solution:
    def hammingWeight(self, n: int) -> int:
        setBits = 0
        while n:
            n &= (n - 1)
            setBits += 1
        return setBits
```
The solution once again runs in O(1), however, in practice it may often run faster than the unoptimized approach since the loop iterates once for each of the 1s in the binary representation of the number rather than running once for each bit in the number. The space complexity remains O(1).
