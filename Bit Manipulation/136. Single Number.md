## Bitwise Approach
This problem is not at all intuitive, but it serves as a good reminder that sometimes we need to look past the abstraction that we take for granted, and get right up close and personal with binary representations of data!

We are guaranteed to have duplicates of each number except for the one singleton, this means that if we represent each number in binary in a vertical format (if need, pad with zeros on the left to align place values), excluding the singleton, each column is guaranteed to have an even number of 1's therefore the XOR operation on the entire column (again ignoring the singleton's value for that column's place value) is going to yield 0, now if we XOR 0 with the value of the singleton at that place value, we will just get the value of the singleton at that place value. Thus, we can XOR all of the numbers together and return the result.
``` python
class Solution:
    def singleNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        res = nums[0]
        for i in range(1, len(nums)):
            res = res ^ nums[i]
        return res
```
This runs in O(n) time since we perform a linear scan, and uses O(1) memory since we don't use any auxiliary memory.
