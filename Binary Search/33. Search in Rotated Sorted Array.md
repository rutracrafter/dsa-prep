Two main cases, if the left half or the right half of the array is sorted, and then within each of these cases we check whether the target is in the sorted half, or in the other half.
``` python
class Solution:
    def search(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
        l = 0
        r = len(nums) - 1
        while l <= r:
            m = (l + r) // 2
            if nums[m] == target:
                return m
            
            if nums[l] <= nums[m]:
                if (target > nums[m]) or (target < nums[l]):
                    l = m + 1
                else:
                    r = m - 1
            else:
                if (target < nums[m]) or (target > nums[r]):
                    r = m - 1
                else:
                    l = m + 1

        return -1
```
The time complexity is O(log(n)) in the worst case. The space complexity is O(1) in the worst case.

Key takeaway:
- Sometimes it just boils down to breaking down into cases, and then further breaking those cases down into sub cases.
