## Binary Search Approach
The best explanation in my opinions is linked here, very detailed and logical explanation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIVW4P8b1VA
``` python
class Solution:
    def findMin(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        minVal = nums[0]
        l = 0
        r = len(nums) - 1

        while l <= r:
            m = (l + r) // 2
            minVal = min(minVal, nums[m])
            if nums[l] < nums[r]:
                minVal = min(minVal, nums[l])
                break
            # In the line below, the <= instead of < covers the edge case for [2,1]
            # because both l and m are at index 0, so the comparison 2 < 2 is false
            # but 2 <= 2 is true, which correctly searches the right half
            elif nums[l] <= nums[m]:
                l = m + 1
            else:
                r = m - 1

        return minVal
```
The time complexity is O(log(n)) in the worst case, since we are just doing a binary search with slightly different update conditions. The space complexity is O(1) in the worst case since we only use a few variables.

## Binary Search Approach (more optimized)
I find this approach better as it is cleaner logic (less edge cases) and less code needed to be written. Basically, if element at m > element at right, we know that the minimum element is in the right half, because at some point in that right half the array goes from a larger value to a smaller value. Otherwise, from m to l, the array is sorted, so we know the element at m is the smallest in the right half, but we can't be sure that it is the smallest in the whole array, so we include the middle element in our search of the left half. Also our while condition is no longer l <= r, it is now just l < r because when l and r overlap, we want to break out of the loop and return the element at l.
``` python
class Solution:
    def findMin(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        l = 0
        r = len(nums) - 1

        while l < r:
            m = (l + r) // 2
            if nums[m] > nums[r]:
                l = m + 1
            else:
                r = m

        return nums[l]

        
```
Time complexity is O(log(n)) in the worst case. Space complexity is O(1) in the worst case.

## Binary Search Approach (more optimized and early stop)
In the case where the element at l < the element at r, we know that from l to r the array is sorted, so we can just immediately return the element at l.
``` python
class Solution:
    def findMin(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        l = 0
        r = len(nums) - 1

        while l < r:
            if nums[l] < nums[r]:
                return nums[l]
            m = (l + r) // 2
            if nums[m] > nums[r]:
                l = m + 1
            else:
                r = m

        return nums[l]
```
Time complexity is O(log(n)) in the worst case but now we have that early stopping condition, so sometimes it stops early. Space complexity is O(1) in the worst case.
