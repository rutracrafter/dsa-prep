## Binary Search Approach
k is going to be at most max(piles), since this would mean Koko eats each piles in one hour (piles.length <= h so this always works). We can then use binary search to zero in on which value of k is optimal for Koko to eat as slowly as possible withing the time h, but still eat all of the bananas.
``` python
class Solution:
    def minEatingSpeed(self, piles: List[int], h: int) -> int:
        l = 1
        r = max(piles)
        result = r

        while l <= r:
            k = (l + r) // 2
            timeToEat = 0
            for p in piles:
                timeToEat += ceil(float(p) / k)
            if timeToEat <= h:
                result = k
                r = k - 1
            else:
                l = k + 1
        
        return result
```
The time complexity is O(n * log(m)) in the worst case where m is the length of piles, and m is the maximum entry in piles. The space complexity is O(1) in the worst case since we only need a few variables to keep track of values.
