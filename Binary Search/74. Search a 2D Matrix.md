## Binary Search Approach
This approach is just good old binary search, with the addition that you must convert the indexing from 1D array form to 2D array form.
``` python
class Solution:
    def searchMatrix(self, matrix: List[List[int]], target: int) -> bool:
        l = 0
        r = len(matrix) * len(matrix[0]) - 1
        while (l <= r):
            m = (r + l) // 2
            m_row = m // len(matrix[0])
            m_col = m % len(matrix[0])
            if matrix[m_row][m_col] == target:
                return True
            elif matrix[m_row][m_col] < target:
                l = m + 1
            else:
                r = m - 1
        
        return False
```
Time complexity is O(log(m * n)) in the worst case. Space complexity is O(1) in the worst case.
