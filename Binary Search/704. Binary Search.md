## Linear Scan Approach
The most straightforward way to approach this problem is to just run through the entire array, until we find the target, otherwise we return -1.
``` python

```
This does not solve the problem, however, since our solution needs to be O(log(n)) and this approach is O(n) in time complexity and O(1) space complexity.
## Binary Search Approach
