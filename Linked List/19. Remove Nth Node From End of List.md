## Two Pointer Approach
We keep two pointers, (n + 1)  distance apart (thanks to the dummy node which also helps us avoid some pretty gnarly edge cases) and we move them together until the leading pointer gets to the end of the list, then we just set the next pointer of the trailing pointer to be the next, next pointer of itself. Finally, return whatever the dummy node it pointing to as that is the head (potentially new) of the list.
``` python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def removeNthFromEnd(self, head: Optional[ListNode], n: int) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        dummy = ListNode(0, head)
        front = head
        back = dummy

        for i in range(n):
            front = front.next
        
        while front:
            front = front.next
            back = back.next
        
        back.next = back.next.next
        return dummy.next
```
The time complexity is O(n) in the worst case, and the space complexity is O(1) in the worst case.
