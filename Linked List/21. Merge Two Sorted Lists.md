## Pointer Approach
For this problem, we are given that the two lists are sorted, which means that all we need to do is have a pointer for each list and create a new list pointer (using a dummy node is a good idea as it helps avoid edge cases like when the list is empty), and compare the values of those nodes to see which one is smaller, then we just point our new list pointer to the node with the smaller value, increment that list's pointer value and move our new list's tail pointer forward once until we reach the end of one of the lists. Now, we must check to see if there are any remaining values in the other list, and if there are we point our new list's tail pointer at it and return the new head (remember that our head for the new list is a dummy node so we actually have to return the node that comes after it!).
``` python
def mergeTwoLists(self, list1: Optional[ListNode], list2: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
	l1 = list1
	l2 = list2
	dummy = ListNode()
	tail = dummy
	while (l1 != None) and (l2 != None):
		if l1.val < l2.val:
			tail.next = l1
			l1 = l1.next
		else:
			tail.next = l2
			l2 = l2.next
		tail = tail.next

	if l1 != None:
		tail.next = l1
	elif l2 != None:
		tail.next = l2

	return dummy.next
```
This solution runs in O(n) time since in the worst case we iterate through every node of each list once. The space complexity is O(1) since we are only allocating the dummy node as additional memory and stitching the two lists together.
