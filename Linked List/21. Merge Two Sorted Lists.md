## Pointer Approach
For this problem, we are given that the two lists are sorted, which means that all we need to do is have a pointer for each list and create a new list pointer (using a dummy node is a good idea as it helps avoid edge cases like when the list is empty), and compare the values of those nodes to see which one is smaller, then we just point our new list pointer to the node with the smaller value, increment that list's pointer value and move our new list pointer over one
