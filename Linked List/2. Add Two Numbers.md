## Iteration Approach
This problem is quite simple, but what can be tricky is just the pointer manipulations. The main idea is, for each step, we add the l1 value, l2 value, and the carry, store the result in the corresponding node, update the carry, and keep doing this until both lists are used up. There is an edge case to be aware of where both lists are fully used up, yet the carry has a nonzero value, in this case, just add a new node with the carry's value.
