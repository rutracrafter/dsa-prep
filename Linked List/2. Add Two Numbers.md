## Iteration Approach
This problem is quite simple, but what can be tricky is just the pointer manipulations. The main idea is, for each step, we add the l1 value, l2 value, and the carry, store the result in the corresponding node, update the carry, and keep doing this until both lists are used up. There is an edge case to be aware of where both lists are fully used up, yet the carry has a nonzero value, in this case, just add a new node with the carry's value.
``` python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def addTwoNumbers(self, l1: Optional[ListNode], l2: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        # Use dummy node to start the list off
        dummy = ListNode(None)
        curr = dummy
        carry = 0
        while l1 and l2:
            addition = l1.val + l2.val + carry
            carry = addition // 10
            value = addition % 10
            newNode = ListNode(value)
            curr.next = newNode
            curr = curr.next
            l1 = l1.next
            l2 = l2.next
        
        while l1:
            addition = l1.val + carry
            carry = addition // 10
            value = addition % 10
            newNode = ListNode(value)
            curr.next = newNode
            curr = curr.next
            l1 = l1.next

        while l2:
            addition = l2.val + carry
            carry = addition // 10
            value = addition % 10
            newNode = ListNode(value)
            curr.next = newNode
            curr = curr.next
            l2 = l2.next
        
        if carry != 0:
            newNode = ListNode(carry)
            curr.next = newNode
            curr = curr.next
        
        return dummy.next
```
The time complexity is O(n + m) in the worst case where n is the length of l1 and m is the length of l2. The space complexity is O(max(n, m)) in the worst case.
## Iteration Approach (Cleaner)
We can do the exact same thing as above with some cleaner code by adding a little bit of extra logic when extracting the values from our l1 and l2 pointers. Basically, when we get the values from l1 and l2, if they are None, we just set v1 and/or v2 to 0 respectively, at the end of the while loop, we also take extra care when updating the l1 and l2 pointers by setting them to None if there is no next pointer.
``` python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def addTwoNumbers(self, l1: Optional[ListNode], l2: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        # Use dummy node to start the list off
        dummy = ListNode(None)
        curr = dummy
        carry = 0
        while l1 or l2 or carry:
            v1 = l1.val if l1 else 0
            v2 = l2.val if l2 else 0

            addition = v1 + v2 + carry
            carry = addition // 10
            value = addition % 10

            curr.next = ListNode(value)
            curr = curr.next

            l1 = l1.next if l1 else None
            l2 = l2.next if l2 else None

        return dummy.next
```
The time complexity is O(n + m) in the worst case where n is the length of l1 and m is the length of l2. The space complexity is O(max(n, m)) in the worst case.
