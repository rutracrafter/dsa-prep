## Find Half, Reverse Second Half, Rejoin Approach
The basic principle of the approach is, if the list is empty or only has one element, just return as it is a trivial case. Then, we use the Tortoise and Hare technique to find the halfway point of the list, from here on out, we treat the first half and second half as two different lists, now we are going to reverse the second half of the list. Note that the way I have done this makes it such that the first half and the reversed second half of the list have the same last node. Then we just 
``` python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def reorderList(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> None:
        if (head == None) or (head.next == None):
            return
        
        slow = head
        fast = head
        while fast and fast.next:
            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next.next
        
        prev = None
        curr = slow
        while curr != None:
            nxt = curr.next
            curr.next = prev
            prev = curr
            curr = nxt
        
        l1 = head
        l2 = prev

        while l2 and l2.next:
            t1 = l1.next
            t2 = l2.next
            
            l1.next = l2
            l2.next = t1
            
            l1 = t1
            l2 = t2
```
Time complexity is O(n) in the worst case, space complexity is O(1) in the worst case.
