In my opinion, in an interview setting, this problem is BS. It is HIGHLY unlikely that an interview candidate would be able to solve this in a 30-60 minute time windows if they have never seen it before. That said, the solution is quite interesting, and could prove to be handy in a future problem.

For the explanation just watch this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjYnzkAhcNk
## Fast and Slow Pointer Approach (Floyd's Cycle Finding Algorithm)
``` python
class Solution:
    def findDuplicate(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        slow, fast = 0, 0
        while True:
            slow = nums[slow]
            fast = nums[nums[fast]]
            if slow == fast:
                break
        
        slow2 = 0
        while slow != slow2:
            slow = nums[slow]
            slow2 = nums[slow2]
        
        return slow
```
The time complexity is O(n) and the space complexity is O(1). See video for explanation or just look up Floyd's Cycle Finding Algorithm for a proof.
