## Pointer Approach
We use three pointers, prev, curr, and nxt to reverse the linked list little by little. prev and nxt start as null (None in python) and curr starts as head. Then while our curr pointers is not null (meaning we have not reached the end of the list) we set nxt to curr's next, curr's next to prev, prev to curr, and curr to nxt. Once the list is reversed (i.e. when curr is null) we return prev as this is the new head.
``` python
def reverseList(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
	prev = None
	curr = head
	nxt = None
	while curr != None:
		nxt = curr.next
		curr.next = prev
		prev = curr
		curr = nxt
	return prev
```
This solution runs in O(n) time and has a space complexity of O(1) since we are only using three pointers.
## Recursive Approach
With this approach we essentially break the problem down into smaller and smaller pieces until we reach the base case, then our reversing of the node occurs from back to front. The best way to see this solution in action is to run through it manually on a few inputs.
``` python
def reverseList(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
	if head == None:
		return None

	newHead = head
	if head.next != None:
		newHead = self.reverseList(head.next)
		head.next.next = head
	head.next = None

	return newHead
```
This solution runs in O(n) time, however, it has a space complexity of O(n) since we are essentially using n frames on the stack.
