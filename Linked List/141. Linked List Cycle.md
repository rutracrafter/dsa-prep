## Set Approach
We create an initially empty set, then we iterate thought the list (while current node is not null) and for each iteration, we check if the current node is in our set, if it is, return true (cycle was found), otherwise, add the current node to the set and move to the next node. If our program ever exits the for loop, this means that no nodes were found to be in the set and our list ended with a node pointing to null, so we return false as no cycle was found.
``` python
def hasCycle(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> bool:
	nodes = set()
	curr = head
	while curr != None:
		if curr in nodes:
			return True
		nodes.add(curr)
		curr = curr.next
	return False
```
This solution runs in O(n) time since in the worst case we must iterate through every node in the list. The space complexity is O(n) since in the worst case we end up adding every single node to the set.
## Floyd's Tortoise and Hare
We use a fast and a slow pointer starting at the beginning of the list, while fast and fast's next are not null (fast moves two at a time so we must check itself and next) we are going to first shift the slow pointer by one, then shift the fast pointer by 2, and finally check if they have met, if they have indeed met, we return true as that means a cycle exists, if we exit the while loop, we return false since that means fast reached the end of the linked list so there is no cycle.
``` python
def hasCycle(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> bool:
	slow = fast = head
	while fast != None and fast.next != None:
		slow = slow.next
		fast = fast.next.next
		if slow == fast:
			return True
	return False
```
