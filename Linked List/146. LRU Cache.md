## Doubly Linked List + Dictionary Approach
We can use a doubly linked list to store the Least Recently Used (LRU) value as the head and the Most Recently Used (MRU) value as the tail. Then any time a value is added or modified, we just need to remove it from where it is, if necessary, and insert it at the tail. Traversing a linked list in search of a node to remove is a O(n) operation, so we can use a dictionary that maps keys to linked list nodes which turns this into a O(1) operation.
