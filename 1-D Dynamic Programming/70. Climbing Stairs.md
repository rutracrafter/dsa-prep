## Recursive Approach
To get to step i, we could either have come from step i - 1 or step i - 2 so to calculate the number of ways to get to step i, we sum the number of ways to get to step i - 1 and step i - 2. The base cases are that it takes 1 step to get to step 1 and 2 steps to get to step 2. (*This recursive approach is not very efficient because we have a recursion tree that grows exponentially*).
``` python
class Solution:
    def climbStairs(self, n: int) -> int:
        if n == 1:
            return 1
        if n == 2:
            return 2

        return self.climbStairs(n - 1) + self.climbStairs(n - 2)
```
The runtime in O(2^n) in the worst case since our decision tree branches two different ways at each step. The space complexity is going to be O(n) as our call stack will grow to at most size n. This is a very inefficient solution due to the O(2^n) runtime, can we do better? Thankfully the answer is yes! If we look at our recursion tree, we see that we are having to make a lot of repeated calls, we can use the dynamic programming technique of Tabulation to prevent these repeated calls.
## Dynamic Programming Approach 1 (Tabulation)
We are essentially going to do the same thing as above, except now, we are going to use an array/list to keep track of the number of steps necessary to get to step i. We use the same base cases as above for the recursive approach.
``` python
class Solution:
    def climbStairs(self, n: int) -> int:
        if n == 1:
            return 1
        if n == 2:
            return 2

        arr = [0] * n
        arr[0] = 1
        arr[1] = 2

        for i in range(2, len(arr)):
            arr[i] = arr[i-1] + arr[i-2]
  
        return arr[-1]
```
The runtime is O(n) in the worst case which is A LOT better than O(2^n). The space complexity is O(n) in the worst case as we end up creating an array of size n.
## Dynamic Programming Approach 2 (Tabulation)
We can do the same as we have done above while keeping the space complexity O(1) by using variables to store our last two values, instead of using an array/list.
``` python
class Solution:

    def climbStairs(self, n: int) -> int:

        if n == 1:

            return 1

        if n == 2:

            return 2

        step1 = 1

        step2 = 2

        for i in range(n - 2):

            tmp = step2

            step2 += step1

            step1 = tmp

        return step2
```
