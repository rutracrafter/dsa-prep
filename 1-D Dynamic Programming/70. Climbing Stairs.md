## Recursive Approach
To get to step i, we could either have come from step i - 1 or step i - 2 so to calculate the number of ways to get to step i, we sum the number of ways to get to step i - 1 and step i - 2. The base cases are that it takes 1 step to get to step 1 and 2 steps to get to step 2. (*This recursive approach is not very efficient because we have a recursion tree that grows exponentially*).
``` python
class Solution:
    def climbStairs(self, n: int) -> int:
        if n == 1:
            return 1
        if n == 2:
            return 2

        return self.climbStairs(n - 1) + self.climbStairs(n - 2)
```
The runtime in O(2)
