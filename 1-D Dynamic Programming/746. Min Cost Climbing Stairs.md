## Recursive Approach
For this approach, we can recursively calculate the min cost of the last two 
## Dynamic Programming Approach
We are going to use an array/list to keep track of the minimum cost to get to step i. To find the minimum cost to get to step i, we need to take the minimum of the cost to get to step i - 1 summed with the cost of step i - 1, and the cost to get to step i - 2 summed with the cost of step i - 2. After the whole array is filled in, we return the minimum of the cost to get to the last step summed with the cost of the last step, and the cost to get to the second to last step summed with the cost of the second to last step.
``` python
class Solution:
    def minCostClimbingStairs(self, cost: List[int]) -> int:
        arr = [0] * len(cost)
  
        arr[0] = 0
        arr[1] = 0

        for i in range(2, len(arr)):
            arr[i] = min(arr[i-1] + cost[i-1], arr[i-2] + cost[i-2])

        return min(arr[-1] + cost[-1], arr[-2] + cost[-2])
```
The time complexity is going to be O(n) in the worst case since we would iterate through almost all n elements of the array when filling it in. The space complexity is going to be O(n) in the worst case since we create an array of size O(n).
