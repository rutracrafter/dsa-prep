## Sliding Window Approach
We use a sliding window to check the condition: if the length of the current substring (denoted by the left and right pointers/indices) minus the count of the most frequent character is less than or equal to k (in the while below we check the inverse since it makes easier iteration conditions). If it is, increment right by one, otherwise, increment left until the condition is true.
``` python
class Solution:
    def characterReplacement(self, s: str, k: int) -> int:
        longest = 0
        count = {}
        mostFrequent = 0
        l = 0
        for r in range(len(s)):
            count[s[r]] = 1 + count.get(s[r], 0)
            mostFrequent = max(mostFrequent, count[s[r]])
  
            while (r-l+1) - mostFrequent > k:
                count[s[l]] -= 1
                l += 1
            longest = max(longest, r-l+1)
        return longest
```
The time complexity is O(n) in the worst case since we pass through each char of the string at most twice. The space complexity is O(n) in the worst case since we would have to add all of the chars in the string to the dictionary.
