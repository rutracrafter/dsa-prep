## Brute Force Approach
We can use a brute force approach to check if for each price, there exists a higher price that we can sell the stock for in the future, however, we must also keep track of the biggest difference of prices that we have found so that we can return the maximum profit.
``` python
def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
	maxDiff = 0
	for i in range(len(prices) - 1):
		for j in range(i + 1, len(prices)):
			diff = prices[j] - prices[i]
			if diff > maxDiff:
				maxDiff = diff
	return maxDiff
```
This approach does not solve the problem as we get a "Time Limit Exceeded" error. This approach runs in O(n^2) time and has a O(1) space complexity.
## Sliding Window Approach
We can have a sliding window where we check to see if the profit from buying on the left and selling on the right is greater than our max profit, and if we ever ec
``` python
def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
	l, r = 0, 1
	maxDiff = 0
	while r < len(prices):
		diff = prices[r] - prices[l]
		if diff > maxDiff:
			maxDiff = diff
		if prices[r] < prices[l]:
			l = r
		r += 1
	return maxDiff
```
blah blah
