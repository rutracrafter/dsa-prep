## Brute Force Approach
We can use a brute force approach to check if for each price, there exists a higher price that we can sell the stock for in the future, however, we must also keep track of the biggest difference of prices that we have found and the indices of the greatest difference so that we can return the days to buy and sell the stocks to maximize profit.
``` python
def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
	maxDiff = 0
	minIndex = maxIndex = 0
	for i in range(len(prices) - 1):
		for j in range(i + 1, len(prices)):
			diff = prices[j] - prices[i]
			if diff > maxDiff:
				maxDiff = diff
				minIndex = i
				maxIndex = j
	return prices[maxIndex] - prices[minIndex]
```
This approach does not solve the problem as we get a "Time Limit Exceeded" error. This approach runs in O(n^2) time and has a O(1) space complexity.
## Sliding Window Approach
