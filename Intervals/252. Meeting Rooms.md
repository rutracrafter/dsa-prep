## Brute Force Approach
We can use a brute force approach to check each of the intervals again all other intervals for any overlap.
``` python
class Solution:
    def canAttendMeetings(self, intervals: List[Interval]) -> bool:
        for i in range(len(intervals) - 1):
            A = intervals[i]
            for j in range(i + 1, len(intervals)):
                B = intervals[j]
                if min(A.end, B.end) > max(A.start, B.start):
                    return False
        return True
```
This runs in O(n^2) time in the worst case since we have to iterate through all other intervals for each interval. The space complexity is O(1) since we don't use any extra memory.
## Sorting Approach
If we first sort the intervals by start time, all we have to do to check for overlap is check if for each of the adjacent intervals, the end time of the left interval is greater than the start time of the right interval. We can do this since the intervals are sorted by start time, which means that a later interval cannot start before an earlier interval, thus allowing us to check only the adjacent pairs instead of all possible pairs of intervals.
``` python
class Solution:
    def canAttendMeetings(self, intervals: List[Interval]) -> bool:
        intervals.sort(key = lambda i: i.start)
        for i in range(len(intervals) - 1):
            if intervals[i].end > intervals[i+1].start:
                return False
        return True
```
The time complexity is O(n * log(n)) in the worst case scenario, since we sort the list then perform a linear scan. The space complexity will depend on the sorting algorithm used, since python uses Timsort, and Timsort has a worst case space complexity of O(n), we get that our space complexity is O(n).

Key Takeaways:
- Sometimes an optimal solution calls for the sorting of data, don't discard sorting just because it takes O(n * log(n)) time.
