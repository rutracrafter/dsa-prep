## HashTable/Dictionary Approach
We can hash each word (lists are not hashable as they are mutable, however, tuples are hashable since they are immutable) and use this to index into a dictionary of lists of words with that same hash.
``` python
class Solution:
    def groupAnagrams(self, strs: List[str]) -> List[List[str]]:
        res = {}
        for s in strs:
            count = [0] * 26
            for c in s:
                count[ord(c) - ord('a')] += 1
            if tuple(count) in res:
                res[tuple(count)].append(s)
            else:
                res[tuple(count)] = [s]
        return list(res.values())
```
The asymptotic time complexity is O(n * k) in the worst case where n is the number of words and k is the length of the largest word. The asymptotic space complexity is also O(n * k) in the worst case. Note that in practice the size of the words is bounded by 100, therefore, the time complexity in that case would be O(n).
## Sorting Approach
``` python
class Solution:
    def groupAnagrams(self, strs: List[str]) -> List[List[str]]:
        anagrams = {}
  
        for word in strs:
            sorted_word = ''.join(sorted(word))
            if sorted_word in anagrams:
                anagrams[sorted_word].append(word)
            else:
                anagrams[sorted_word] = [word]
        result = []

        for item in anagrams.values():
            result.append(item)
        return result
```
The asymptotic time complexity is O(n * (k * log(k))) in the worst case where n is the number of words and k is the length of the largest word since sorting the word takes O(k * log(k)) time. The space complexity would O(n * (kn)) since Timsort uses O(k) space. Note that in practice the size of the words is bounded by 100, therefore, the time complexity in that case would be O(n).
