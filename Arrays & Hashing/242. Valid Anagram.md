[Leetcode Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-anagram/)
## Array Approach
The first approach that jumps out to me would be to use two arrays of size 26 (since we are dealing with only lowercase English letters) to store the counts of each letter in s and t, this would allow us to compare the counts and if they are equal, then s and t are anagrams of each other, whereas if the counts are not equal, then they are not.
``` Python
def isAnagram(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
	sCount = [0] * 26
	tCount = [0] * 26

	# Get char counts
	for sChar in s:
		sCount[ord(sChar) - 97] += 1
	for tChar in t:
		tCount[ord(tChar) - 97] += 1

	# Check if counts match
	for i in range(26):
		if sCount[i] != tCount[i]:
			return False
	return True
```
This solution has a O(n) time complexity (constants are dropped!) and a O(1) space complexity since the array is of the fixed size 26.
## Set Approach
Using an array is a valid option as it has O(1) lookup time and O(, however, what if the requirement of the problem were to change and the inputs could now be any Unicode characters? Using an array with the size of all Unicode characters is still a valid options as teachical
