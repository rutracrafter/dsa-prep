[Leetcode Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-anagram/)
## Array Approach
The first approach that jumps out to me would be to use two arrays of size 26 (since we are dealing with only lowercase English letters) to store the counts of each letter in s and t, this would allow us to compare the counts and if they are equal, then s and t are anagrams of each other, whereas if the counts are not equal, then they are not.
