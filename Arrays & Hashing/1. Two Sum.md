[Leetcode Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/description/)
## Brute Force Approach
We are searching for the two numbers that add up to the target value, the most obvious way to do this is by comparing each element with every other element.
``` Python
for i in range(len(nums) - 1):
	for j in range(i + 1, len(nums)):
		if nums[i] + nums[j] == target:
			return [i, j]
```
This approach actually does not time out despite having a O(n^2) runtime. The space complexity of this approach is O(1).
## Set Approach
We can use a set to keep track of what numbers we have already encountered and for each element, check if the difference of the current element and the target is in the set. If it is, we know that
