## Two Pass Approach
We can pass once left to right and once right to left to calculate the product of all the values to the left and right (respectively) of the element at position i. We can do this because multiplication is commutative.
``` python
class Solution:
    def productExceptSelf(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        before = [0] * len(nums)
        after = [0] * len(nums)
        result = [0] * len(nums)
  
        product = 1
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            product *= nums[i]
            before[i] = product
  
        product = 1
        for i in range(len(nums) - 1, -1, -1):
            product *= nums[i]
            after[i] = product
  
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if i == 0:
                result[i] = after[i+1]
            elif i == len(nums) - 1:
                result[i] = before[i-1]
            else:
                result[i] = before[i-1] * after[i+1]
        return result
```
The time complexity is O(n) and the space complexity if O(n).
## Two Pass Approach (Optimized)
We are doing the same thing as above, except we are using less extra memory via the use of some slightly clever logic that prevents us from needing to allocate two unnecessary arrays as in the previous solution.
``` python
class Solution:
    def productExceptSelf(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        result = [1] * len(nums)
		
        sum = 1
        for i in range(len(nums)-1):
            sum *= nums[i]
            result[i+1] *= sum
		
        sum = 1
        for i in range(len(nums)-1, 0, -1):
            sum *= nums[i]
            result[i-1] *= sum
			
        return result
```
The time complexity is O(n) and the space complexity is O(n) (or O(1) depending whether the array to store the result is considered additional memory or not, apparently different people have different opinions on this, but I am choosing to stick with the idea that the output array is considered additional memory). Note that asymptotically the two solutions have the same space complexity, however, when not looking through an asymptotic lens, the optimized solution uses less space since using two less arrays, basically O(3n) = O(n), however, 3n != n. This is something that should be taken into account when talking about asymptotic performance.
