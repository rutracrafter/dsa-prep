## Set Approach
The start of a sequence cannot be preceded by a value that consecutively comes before it, so for each number we check if (num - 1) is in the set. If it is not, then we know that this is not the start of a sequence so we skip it, if it is, then we check how long the sequence is.
``` python
class Solution:
    def longestConsecutive(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        longest = 0
        nums_set = set(nums)
		
        for num in nums_set:
            if num - 1 not in nums_set:
                length = 1
                while num + length in nums_set:
                    length += 1
                longest = max(longest, length)
		
        return longest
```
The time complexity is O(n) since any numbers that are
